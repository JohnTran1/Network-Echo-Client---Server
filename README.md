Network-Echo-Client---Server
============================

CS380 Project 1

In this project, you will be implementing an echo server and client. Basically, the client will connect to the
server and then the user can type in messages. These messages are transferred to the server which will then
echo them back to the client. The client should then print the serverâ€™s response.
